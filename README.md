# prettybasicmaps

Prettybasicmaps is a webapp to create beautiful artsy maps from OpenStreetMap data.

The underlying Python package is a rewrite of the fantastic [prettymaps](https://github.
com/marceloprates/prettymaps) project. Credit for the original implementation, ideas and designs go solely to it's 
author [@marceloprates](https://github.com/marceloprates). 
The prettybasicmaps rewrite drops the more complex configuration options in favour of improved speed, reduced code 
complexity and simplified configuration interfaces. It is fully tested and adds a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) 
webapp.

## Development
Interactive installation + changes in package require app restart.


## TODO
- Cleanup examples
- svg vs png display quality?
